# a non-local Certificate authority, you must specify a class_name: fully.qualified.ClassName to a
# implementing subclass of AbstractSigner.  fully.qualified.ClassName must be importable
# on PYTHONPATH.  If 'class_name' is not given in a specific manifest, it is assumed to be
# cergen.certificate.Certificate.
